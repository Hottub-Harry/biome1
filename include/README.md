# Vison

In this project, I create a simple world in which small creatures live. The creatures have simple neural networks that control whether they live or die.
The world, is a grid of X by Y units, that should be able to be set by the utils (currently set at 500 by 500). The death zone is a definable area in the 
world map that the creatures must escape. Upon successful escape, creatures are awarded by mating, which mixes their neurons, and the cycle continues.
After a few generations, all of the creatures should be trained to escape the death zone.  It will be interesting to see what we discover from this simulation. 

# Methods

ToDo: get someone else to do this

# Roadmap

Right now, the creatures are only able to be trained to avoid the "death zone". In the future, the creatures must survive predation and find food.

# Contribute

Mostly, this project is being completed on kick (https://kick.com/hottub-harry). I intend to do all the hard parts myself on stream, as I am trying to learn and grow.
If you have any suggestions, or time for a code review, this would be much appreciated. Open an issue with your suggestion and I will consider it, and add credit where it is due.
